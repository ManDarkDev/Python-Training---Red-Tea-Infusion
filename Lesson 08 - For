#Lesson 8 

#for - Iterates over elements of a sequence or iterable.
#else - Executes if loop completes without break.
#len() - Returns number of items in an object.
#range() - Generates sequence of numbers for looping.
#break() - Exits the loop before it naturally completes.


numbers = [ 0, 1, 2, 3]# - Initializes list 'numbers' with elements 0, 1, 2, 3.
print(numbers)

for n in numbers:# - Iterates over each element in 'numbers'.
    print(n)
for i in range (10):# - Loops ten times, 'i' from 0 to 9.
    print(i)

my_name = 'Red'# - Assigns the string 'Red' to variable 'my_name'
print(my_name[0])# - Prints first character of 'my_name'.
print(len(my_name))# - Prints length of 'my_name

for i in range (len(my_name)): # - len(my_name) returns 3 because there are three characters in the string 'Red'.
    print(my_name[i])

matrix = []# - Initializes an empty list 'matrix
for i in range(1,3):# - Loops with 'i' values 1 and 2.
    for j in range(4):# - Inner loop, 'j' from 0 to 3
        pair =[i,j] #Creates list 'pair' with current 'i' and 'j
        matrix.append(pair)
        print('i=', i, 'j=', j)
print(matrix)

for i in range (5):# - Loops with 'i' from 0 to 4
    if i > 2:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print('the loop is finished')
